# Idea
Discord bot for bans, kicks, and other punishments with a basic set of rules. (#RULES channel) Mods can take immediate action, but appeals go to virtual court.. (continue off at the virtual court tag)

# Virtual Court
Appeals involve both parties providing basic proof like screenshots and their side of the story.
AI reviews the information and makes a decision based on both sides.

### Example of how the process might go:
1. **Complainant (Moderator)** (The person who issued the punishment)
   - Presents evidence of rule violation.
   - Explains the reason for the punishment.

1. **Defendant (Person appealing)** (The person who issued abuse/appeal)
   - Provides counter-evidence. (for example maybe some screenshots of full context)
   - Responds to the presented evidence by the complainant
   - (optional), Articulates their perspective on the incident.

1. **AI Decisions** (automated machine to try handle this issue in an unbiased way)
   - AI Reviews presented evidence from both sides to try build a story in its head
   - Considers both sides arguments and compares result
   - Renders a verdict based on the information provided
   - if the verdict is to vague or found false then the appeal is accepted automatically
   - if its none of the above we'll do some more minor filtering

1. **AI Decisions Verdict Detailed**
   - If evidence is conclusive. AI will adjust the punishment or dismiss it accordingly.
   - In case of unclear evidence or conflicting stories, the appeal is automatically accepted & put on for further review by an owner
   - If the AIs decision is consented then it'll also be automatically be accepted then forwarded to an owner
   - Overall goal with this system is to ensure a fair and automated process for handling appeals and maintaining a balanced community both ways (Staff & members alike, we dont like abusive staff)
