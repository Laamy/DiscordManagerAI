# Notes
I also want to expand on this to hire and demote staff completely automatically

# Idea
discord bot which handles bans kicks & other punishments with a basic set of rules (for example mods & other staff can kick ban mute warn ect instantly but if someone appeals it then it goes to virtual court)

# Virtual Court
if one of those punishments want/require appeal then the two parties will need to provide proof on each other in a virtual court case, the AI will go over the information its gotten and make a choice based off what both parties said.
